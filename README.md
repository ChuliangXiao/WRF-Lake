# WRF-Lake
1-D lake model in WRF

The lake  module in WRF (original called LISSS, Subin et al. 2012) was obtained from the Community Land Model version 4.5 with some modifications by Gu et al. (2015), based on the origional concept of Hostetler and Bartlein (1990), which performs quite well in shallow lakes (depth < 50 m). (Incorporated in WRF since v3.6 http://www2.mmm.ucar.edu/wrf/users/wrfv3.6/updates-3.6.html). Our work (Xiao et al. 2016) further updated the lake module in WRF with the surface albedo scheme and vertical diffusivity to improve the lake surface temperature and lake ice simulation in the Great Lakes.
